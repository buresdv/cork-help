![Cork Onboarding Screen](./Assets/Onboarding.png)

When you start up Cork for the first time, you will see the **Onboarding** screen. It lets you select how complex of an experience you'd like to have by sliding the slider on the *Basic ↔ Advanced* axis.

Click **Show details** to see exactly which features will be turned on and off for each complexity level

You can bring this onboarding screen up again at any time by clicking **Cork** in the Menu Bar, then selecting **Show Onboarding…**.
