Cork is a graphical user interface for Homebrew. Homebrew is a very powerful package manager for macOS, which is something like the App Store. It allows you to install apps and terminal utilities from a centralized location, without having to go to a developer's website.

You can refer to Homebrew's [website](https://brew.sh) to learn more.

## Relationship Between Cork and Homebrew

Cork serves as a graphical user interface for Homebrew.

The biggest disadvantage of Homebrew is that you have to interact with it through the Terminal, instead of it being a standalone app like Messages or Safari.

You can use Cork to work with Homebrew through a more convenient user interface.

In essence, you can use Homebrew without Cork, but you can't use Cork without Homebrew.

## Cork Terminology

While Cork inherits most terminology from Homebrew, it makes a few changes to be more understandable.
